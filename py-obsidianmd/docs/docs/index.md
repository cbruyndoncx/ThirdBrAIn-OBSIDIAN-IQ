# What is py-obsidianmd ?

py-obsidianmd is a python library designed to modify your Obsidian notes' metadata in **batch**.
In particular, it enables you to move metadata between the **frontmatter** and **[inline (dataview notation)](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/annotation/add-metadata/#inline-fields)**

Checkout the [examples section](examples.md) for a quickstart on how to use the library, and [reference](reference.md) for method documentation.

**! WARNING !** Consider backing up your vault before using the library, to avoid any risk of data loss.

# Installation

Using pip:
```
pip install py-obsidianmd
```
